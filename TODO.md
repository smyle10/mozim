## TODO
 * Thread design
 * `make install`
 * `mozimc start eth1` also cancel old one
 * `mozimc query`
 * `mozimc apply <config>`
 * `mozimc stop eth1`
 * DHCPv4
 * DHCPv6
 * Timeout support of processing socket IPC.

## Good to have
 * Permission: every can query, root can write.
 * Allow environment variable overriding the socket path
 * Don't use `all` feature for tokio dependency.
